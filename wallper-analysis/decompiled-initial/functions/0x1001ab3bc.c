// limitations: This session opens a caller-selected existing Ghidra project through a private copy, without import, auto-analysis or repair scripts. Original analysis completeness and settings are unknown.; The original project is never opened by Ghidra or modified. The private copy is read-only to bridge operations and deleted on close; original executable bytes are never written.; The analysis profile records the selected project content fingerprint and program name. The imported program SHA-256 must match the admitted target; the project may contain caller annotations or earlier edits, which are not fresh REA discoveries.; Default-space addresses use lowercase 0x-prefixed hexadecimal; other address spaces use <percent-encoded-space>:0x<hex>.; macOS sessions require a matching executable Ghidra native decompiler; REA checks for it but does not build native components or change Gatekeeper quarantine state.; Pseudocode is Ghidra decompiler output, not original source and not text-equivalent to Hopper output.; External functions and functions without an analyzable body return null; other decompiler failures remain explicit.
